## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Javan, also known as **CassJah**. Here's a little about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrating AI with geotechnical engineering and developing full-stack applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and evolving my skills in cloud computing, full-stack development, and AI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborations on innovative tech projects, particularly those that blend tech with real-world applications like electric skateboarding.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about geotechnical engineering, AI integration, and software development.
