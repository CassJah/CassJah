## Kia ora 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Javan, but you can call me **CassJah**. Here’s a bit about what I’m up to:

- 🔭 Right now, I’m mixing AI with geotechnical engineering and full-stack development.
- 🌱 Always learning—cloud, AI, full-stack... just keen to explore what’s out there.
- 🌀 Love blending **tech** with **electric skateboarding**—check out my brand, Chillboarders Aotearoa.
- 👯 Open to vibing on cool projects, especially if they match my style.
- 💬 Chat to me about **geotech**, **AI**, or **coding**—I’m always up for a kōrero.
- 📫 Flick me a message at [j.cassidy@outlook.co.nz], or take a look at [Chillboarders Aotearoa]("coming soon").
- ⚡ Fun fact: Chillboarders is where skate culture meets "laidback since wayback" vibes 🏄‍♂️🔥

🌿 _Kia kaha_—keep it real and keep growing.
